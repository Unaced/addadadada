idk how to do it but i think i did it well

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

border-radius{
  makes the corners round
}
display-flex && flex-direction: column && padding{
  i actually copied this from other website so i dont know how this thing works but it works

  flex-direction: column

}
box-shadow{

}

top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%){
  i copied this text from bard so i can't understand the transform: translate thing

  i asked google bard to explain that code and while it did explain, i stil cant understand it 

  edit: i asked it again but to chatgpt this time, and oh my god i understood 50% of it amazing
}


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)
